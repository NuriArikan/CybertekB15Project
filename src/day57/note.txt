Exception Handling In Java.
---------------------------

Exception -> Exception event, situation
---------------

In Java, Exceptions are ERRORs that happen during runtime.

Lets say you have code with 200 lines, that is running and at line 105 some exception happens.

2 options:
	- you let your code to fail and stop
	- you can handle the exception programmatically
----------------------------


java program writing and execution process:

We write our java code and save it with .java extension.

HelloWorld.java --> Compiler --> HelloWorld.class --> Run

As we see in the flow, it needs to be compiled first then executed. So Compiler will check everything: syntax, data types matching(int n = "java") etc before completing compilation process. If compiler sees something is wrong, we will see COMPILE ERROR.

COMPILE ERROR -> happens during compile process, and it is due to programmer's mistake. We need to fix them for our program to be able to successfully run.


When your code is running, it will run top to bottom line by line, when java sees a line that has error, it will THROW EXCEPTION. RUNTIME EXCEPTION.
